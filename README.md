## Large Language Model (LLM) Testing and Experiment UI

The goal of this project is to facilitate interacting with and exploring prompt efficacy with local models for both students and researchers. This uses a react/NextJS front end with a flask backend.
At the moment this will require local storage of the model to run, but future features will include connecting to remote endpoints. 

### Planned Features
* Live conversational interface (Chatbot)
  * Exporting current conversation to file 
  * Simulating/exporting a conversation from a file for sequential prompts

### Planned model backend support
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
